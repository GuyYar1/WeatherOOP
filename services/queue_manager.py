# How Does asyncio.Queue Work?
# A Queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order, meaning that the first item added to the queue is the first one to be retrieved.
# Key methods of asyncio.Queue:
# put(item): Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, it waits until a slot becomes available.
# get(): Removes and returns an item from the queue. If the queue is empty, it waits until an item is available.
# get_nowait(): Returns an item immediately if available, otherwise raises an exception (similar to a non-blocking get).
# join(): Blocks until all items in the queue have been processed (useful for synchronization).
# task_done(): Indicates that a task (item) has been fully processed (used by consumers).
# qsize(): Returns the number of items in the queue.
# The queue size can be infinite (if maxsize is less than or equal to zero) or limited (if maxsize is a positive integer).
# Unlike the standard libraryâ€™s queue, the size of an asyncio.Queue is always known and can be queried using qsize().
# Concurrency and Threads:
# asyncio.Queue is designed for asynchronous code, not for multithreading.
# It operates within a single thread (typically the event loop thread).
# Producers and consumers (coroutines) can work concurrently within the same thread.
# If you need multithreading, consider using the standard queue module instead.
