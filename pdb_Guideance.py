When the # # breakpoint is hit, youâ€™ll be in the debugger.
Use the following commands to inspect variables:
p variable_name: Print the value of a specific variable.
pp variable_name: Pretty-print the value (useful for dictionaries and complex objects).
locals(): Display all local variables in the current scope.
globals(): Display all global variables.
Navigate through the call stack using up, down, and other debugger commands.
Remember to replace variable_name with the actual variable names you want to inspect. You can explore further by examining local and global variables within the context of your nested instance
you may specific type the variables and you will get and answer
